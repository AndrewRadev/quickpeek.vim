INSTALLATION                                            *quickpeek-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone https://github.com/AndrewRadev/quickpeek.vim ~/.vim/bundle/quickpeek
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add https://github.com/AndrewRadev/quickpeek.vim bundle/quickpeek
<

Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: autoload, doc, ftplugin, plugin.


==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                            *quickpeek-requirements*

The plugin needs Vim with popup window support (v8.1 with a large patch
number), otherwise it'll silently do nothing. If you'd like to check if you
have popups, try:
>
    :echo exists('*popup_create')
<
If you get the value of "1", that means you have popup support.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                          *quickpeek-usage*

Turn on/off preview popup (commands only defined in quickfix window):
>
    :Quickpeek
    :QuickpeekStop
    :QuickpeekToggle
<
It's recommended to create a mapping for `QuickpeekToggle`, for instance, in
`~/.vim/ftplugin/qf.vim`, you can do this:
>
    nnoremap <buffer> <c-p> :QuickpeekToggle<cr>
<
To turn preview popup on automatically, put this in your `.vimrc`:
>
    let g:quickpeek_auto = v:true
<
Note that auto mode is currently experimental and results in some weird issues
for me sometimes. If you end up with popups hanging around, you can close all
of them with `:call popup_close()`.

You can customize the popup that shows up using the
|g:quickpeek_popup_options| variable.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                    *quickpeek-settings*

                                                              *g:quickpeek_auto*
>
    let g:quickpeek_auto = v:true
<
Default value: v:false

If set to |v:true| (or 1), the plugin will automatically open a preview
whenever the quickfix or location list window is opened. Note that this
currently break things sometimes and requires some debugging. If you run into
issues, it's recommended to trigger popups manually.

                                                     *g:quickpeek_popup_options*
>
    let g:quickpeek_popup_options = {'title': 'Preview'}
<
Default value: {}

Additional popup options can be given that will be added to the |popup_create|
call. For example:
>
    let g:quickpeek_popup_options = {
        \ 'borderchars': ['-', '|', '-', '|', '+', '+', '+', '+'],
        \ 'title':       'Preview',
        \ 'time':        3000,
        \ }
<
This will change the title to "Preview" (by default, it's the name of the
buffer), give the border a more ASCII look, and hide the popup in 3 seconds.

The full list of options can be read in the helpfiles for
|popup_create-arguments|. Some options won't really make sense -- for
instance, adding a close button will work, but a new preview popup is created
on every move to a different line, so closing a popup might not do what you'd
intuitively expect it to.

                                                   *g:quickpeek_window_settings*
>
    let g:quickpeek_window_settings = []
<
Default value: ["cursorline", "number", "relativenumber"]

A list of settings to turn on in the quickpeek popup window. Each of these is
executed with |:setlocal|. The default values provide a cursorline and
(relative) line numbers, because that seems like a reasonable default for a
peek into context around a particular line. If you'd like to remove them, just
set the variable to an empty array.

                                               *g:quickpeek_popup_scroll_up_key*
                                             *g:quickpeek_popup_scroll_down_key*
>
    let g:quickpeek_popup_scroll_up_key   = ""
    let g:quickpeek_popup_scroll_down_key = ""
<
Default value: "\<c-k>" and "\<c-j>", respectively

These two keys can be used to scroll the preview window up and down. By
default, they're mapped to <c-k> and <c-j>, but if you use those mappings for
other things, or you just want something different, these are the settings to
change.

Set any of them to an empty string to avoid setting up a mapping.

                                                             *g:quickpeek_delay*
>
    let g:quickpeek_delay = 200
<
Default value: 100

The default time delay before updating the popup. Setting this to 0 will
ensure that the popup is updated in the next iteration of Vim's event loop.
If you scroll through the list by holding j/k, this may slow it down a bit.

The default value of 100ms makes it smoother to scroll fast through the list,
and it updates fast enough that it shouldn't be practically inconvenient.

This is implemented by using |timer_start()|, so if your Vim doesn't have
|+timers|, there will be no delay.
